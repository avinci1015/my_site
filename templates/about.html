<h1>About Anthony:</h1>
<p>I'm from a small farm town in New York, what most consider "upstate". I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. After I graduate I'm moving to Stamford,CT.</p>


<p>I study International Business and Computer Information Systems at Quinnipiac University. I'm a graduating Senior, looking for a job in Business Technology Consulting. Aside from school, I love to travel, work on international aide project, and swim. I'm always down for a night out, having a good time is important!</p>

<p> Eventually, I want to live and work abroad for a company, for about 10 years. Primarily in Eastern Europe.</p>
